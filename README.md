## description of project

This project aims to celebrate the legacy of classic bands by showcasing their photos and biographies. It highlights the pivotal moments, achievements, and contributions of iconic groups across various genres. The goal is to provide an insightful, visually engaging tribute to the music and influence of these legendary bands.

## project setup instructions

To create my website showcasing classic bands, I’ll start by planning the structure, including a homepage, individual band pages, and a gallery. I’ll choose a platform like custom HTML design. I’ll secure a domain name and hosting provider and pick a theme that reflects the music aesthetic. I’ll gather high-quality images and well-researched biographies, ensuring I have permission for the photos. I’ll optimize the content for SEO and integrate social media sharing buttons. After testing for mobile responsiveness, I’ll launch and promote the site, regularly updating with fresh content to keep it engaging.

## link to live site on GitHub Pages

The primary goal of my project is to improve a user-friendly website that provides access to images of some classic and inspirational bands.
